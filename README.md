# Uzume

A basic Haskell lib, I'm using for my projects

I'll update it often (since I have an idea)

---

File quick description :

- check : checking things (return Bool only)
- operation : convertion to something else, or evaluate something
- parsing : classic function of parsing, for types, and binary arguments

---

Build with Makefile :

```
make
```

Additionals rules :

```
make + re || clean || fclean
```
